# hackTyper
hackTyper is a simple terminal application written in C++. I'm so bored so I made this.
<br />You can pretend you're doing something important or something interesting.
## How to use this
### For absolutely beginners
The executible Windows program in the **master** branch **ONLY** supports **64-bit windows**. Download it if your PC/laptop is using 64-bit Windows.
<br />HOWEVER, if you are using a **32-bit Windows**, that's fine. Download the source file named **htyper-v2.cpp** to your computer, and install a tiny IDE to your computer,
<br />**BLOODSHED Dev-C++**. After the installing procedure, load the source file with Dev-C++, and press ***F11*** on your keyboard to compile it.
#### For the MacBook users
Download the source file **htyper-v2-linux.cpp** to your computer. Then access the folder with the source file in your terminal. Then enter this command in your terminal:
'''
g++ -O hacktyper htyper-v2-linux.cpp -lm
'''
And then enjoy it.
If you get an error that 'g++' is not in your computer or sth, run this command in your terminal:
'''
sudo apt-get gcc gcc-c++
'''
After downloading, re-enter the command above to compile the source code.
<br />After compiling, run this in your terminal:
'''
./hacktyper
'''
